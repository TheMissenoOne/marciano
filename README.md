# Marciano
This is a vanilla JavaScript game project built during the first period of the ETEC Doutora Ruth Cardoso IT Technical Course. The game is called Marciano and it follows the story of a Martian who arrives in a forest and hides behind one of the 100 trees when he sees a hunter. The hunter only has 5 bullets in his shotgun. Every time he shoots and misses, the Martian would say, "I'm more to the left," "I'm more to the right." If the hunter cannot hit the Martian, he will be captured by the Martian and taken to Mars.

# Getting Started
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your browser of choice. There are no additional dependencies required.

# How to Play
The game is fairly simple to play. To begin, click the "Play" button on the home screen. The game will start with the Martian hiding behind one of the 100 trees. The hunter has to guess the tree where the Martian is hiding and shoot at it. If the hunter misses, the Martian will give a hint about the direction in which the hunter should go next. The player has to use these hints to adjust and try again. The game ends when the hunter hits the Martian or runs out of bullets. If the hunter cannot hit the Martian, he will be captured and taken to Mars.
